RDML Implementation
Reference:
    Jin, R., Wang, S., & Zhou, Y. (2009). Regularized distance metric learning: Theory and algorithm.
    In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 862-870).

Overview:
    The algorithm examines the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning. It shows that with appropriate constraints, the generalization error could be independent from dimensionality, making it suitable for high-dimensional data. An efficient online learning algorithm is also presented, which has been found to be effective and robust in empirical studies.

    Implements the Regularized Discriminative Metric Learning (RDML) algorithm.
    
    Parameters:
        X (np.ndarray): The input data matrix.
        Y (np.ndarray): The labels associated with the input data.
        lambda_val (float, optional): The regularization parameter. Defaults to 0.1.
        num_iterations (int, optional): The number of iterations for the algorithm. Defaults to 1000.
        
    Returns:
        None: The function modifies the input data in-place.
